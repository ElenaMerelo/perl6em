*Perl 6, the musical

** ℵ - Principles

*** Learning should be fun and engaging: learn by doing.
*** You are the master of your learning process, and tools, and outcome. 
*** Learning never stops.
*** Learning is a two-way process. There is no professor, no student: learning happens ideally in a community. 

** α - Motivation

*** Teaching programming to (almost) non-programmers.
*** Contemplate the possibilities of Perl 6 as a beginner's language.
*** Show the beauty and craft of programming.
