Dec 8th, 11:00 AM. 

Let's go into the ideation phase, while not leaving the immersion phase http://www.mjvinnovation.com/blog/three-phases-design-thinking-immersion-ideation-prototyping

** 3. Tools (30 minutes+)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :Tools:    Laptop
   :Chapter:  1
   :END:

Set up tools, starting with the editor. Atom, emacs, anything like
that, command line, how to work with it, minimal Linux, which is the
environment of choice. 
** 4. Perl 6 (30 minutes)

Set it up, understand the REPL. 

Install rakudobrew and start to work with it. Class itself took like 15 minutes, and the rest was devoted to compiling latest version of MoarVM. Note: the $ in the documentation can be mistaken for a command. 

** 5. What is free software (30 minutes)

Probably a good talk for a Sunday morning. What is free software and
free licenses, what they mean, what it's like to create and produce
free software, why everything we do when learning a language should be
free so that other benefit from it.  

We are telling the story of Java, how it is about to become the cash
crop of Oracle who's attempting to ask for licenses, and what kind of
licenses here are and what we should do about it. 


** 6. Teamwork with git (30 minutes)

The first part of this session should be used to create an ID with
GitHub or, if that's created already, to create repositories that will
be used to host the assignments and other tests. We will also learn to
collaborate using Markdown. 

An issue in this session is to learn to use the correct license, or at
least a license, for the work that will be done. A side effect is to
learn and use GitHub as a place to look for code, and how to fork a
repository to work on it. Pull requests, if time allows, if it does
not, let's yield to the next session.

*** Actual development

Sign up for GitHub, create a repository and actually *do nothing* with
it. Look up Perl6 and other repos, and modify them and create pull
requests. 

Unexpected hurdles (actually I have found this before): giving the
repository a name, finding something to do a pull request, things like
that. 

** 7. What we know so far

Writeup of what we have learned so far and what we want to
learn. Probably "home" assignment. 

*Actual*: we have talked about free software, a bit about Perl6, a bit
 about teamwork... Some are getting impatient over the actual lack of
 learning Perl6. So we'll have to go to that soon. Also talked a bit
 about [[https://github.com/ajs/perl6-Math-Sequences][Working on a
 Library about sequences]]. A pull request that, BTW, was accepted
 just today, on Christmas Day.

*Conclusions*: maybe we are out-zenning a bit with doing 7 sessions
 without a real hint of what Perl6, or for that matter any other
 language, is about. 

** Let's work with data.
